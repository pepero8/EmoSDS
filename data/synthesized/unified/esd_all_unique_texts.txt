The nine the eggs I keep
I did go and made many prisoners
That I owe my thanks to you
They went up to the dark mass job had pointed out
Clear than clear water
Andy whats the gyre and to gimble
Im as bad as I can be
That was his chief thought
On the twenty second of last march
A nauseous draught
Chapter ten a warm welcome
Her shoes were like fishes
I have bunburyed all over goat on two separate occasions
Annie please please dont hurt me
Poor Tom now is dead
Mister share man I move for a division
Why has this egg not broken
Then sadly it is much farther
At the end of four
At the rootsof a bush of a grass
As richas Peters son in law
And what are doves And what are doves
I thought you meant how old are you
The football teams give a tea party
She is now choosing skirt to wear
Lets make the noise a snake
Monster made a deep bow
She had said so that one could keep up a conversation
Rat came and replied on the leaves
Must a name mean something
All smile were real and the happier the more sincere
Who is been repeating all that hard stuff to you
This used to be Jerrys occupation
A divine wrath made her blue eyes awful
The name really is the agedaged man
How I hate this foul pool
I think itll encourage me
Hold up my chin slow and solid
Our thanks to Gods oath
In which fox loses a tail and its elder sister finds one
I chose the right way
She may mind ye of her
Story twenty nine a boy and a monkey
Take courage all isnt lost yet
The nastiest things they saw were the cobwebs
Theyd never know Id regular ran away
please excuse me
You are not a runawaywho are you
Then we all say aha
Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge
Said the American to Chinese
From August eighteenth of their divorce
He was still in the forest
Are you a regular darkey really
A deafening chirruping rent the air
Your midget wife never can sing a song
Hannibal come to see you
The octopus has eight legs
Zero four three a silver shilling is journey
That I am a born nurse
Midyear is day shire year
Tom went on eeyore gloomily
Asteroid three hundred and twenty five
And we are so thirsty
Tom could hardly speak for laughing
Shall we let barbara in
I suppose no it doesnt
I do not eat bread
Not much use is it sam
Tom now let our arrows fly
She was born on april nineteen forty three
How are you dear child
how suspicious this fox
Come on my jack in the boxes
Id far rather go without them than eat them
The hag looked in the stove
But I saw you walking
The art quite safe with me
All my gum tips gone as well
Then there was a report
And I never had a whooping cough why
A fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be
Be off now as quick as you may
By hook or by crook
Suppose I take grandmother a fresh vegetable
And tick a tack too
A hippo lives in the zoo
In my opinion thatis a good idea
Let go of my top knot
And they did push so
We expected Tom would jump for joy
Does the one that wins get the crowned
To buy two pork chops
They found a cow grazing in a field
Aha what i have we here
I dont painted tiger
Confess that you opened the thirteenth door
Said the witch
Ive hit the wrong nose
Well anyhow it didnt rain he said
Its me piglit help help
This is Jack the relatives of Tom
The elephant and the carpenter is the longest
Here am i whom you seek
He was killed by an arrow
I guess its a choice feast
Tom and Michael woke up next morning
The squire himself showed perfect
If they mother knew it
Act drop second act scene
We nightly dance our heyday guise
Clown to call him joey
Mister lawson saw george last night
A half pounds of flour and two ounces suet
He might call it for example
No I burst the balloon
They were children of mine
Look out said Alice
The owl flew into a bush
Our King George is labourers
Finn and the fairy shoemaker
Am I an absolute pauper
I am from towel land
You know answers to the name of Toms son
To catch that bulrush root with my paw
this turn goes to the hill
Cos I know I had some honey
Put that rude grasshopper in jail
A large flat ferry boat was moored besideit
And would spoil my joke
It must come sometimes to jam a day
I thank you for this mercy
I smell the breath of an English
Rare rabbit had a little apron
I blinked my eyes hard
She has eaten the tapioca allof it
Let the glass globe be
But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs
Cuckoos is downheaded and crying
What an impetuous boy he is
Can I lodge here tonight
Wake now my merry tads
Pussy can sit by the fire and sing
We all see panda on TV or in the zoo
Reed by the living pool
He said to Jack the chatterer
And there youll find a snap dragon fly
And on the top of them came Winnie the cute bear
My winding sheet
I hope you enjoyed yourself
All the way to China is home
Guilty for what do you rule
But we are not high yet
He dreamt them all night
This speech roused dame ilse to anger
The eye could not catch them
Blackbird and Jay
it looks much better
Such tunes are joy to a dancing fay
Kitty can you play chess
Thats a full grown colt
I lent george three pounds
How they went to the mountains to eat nuts
His large mouth curled into a sneer
They were going fast with a light clip
They ate beef at the butcher shop
I toy with my liqueur
I said you looked like an egg sir
Sam waved his arm vaguely
But if you hadnt done them
I say neither yea nor nay
I shall say good bye
He searched through the box
I pay half a crown a week extra
All this have we won by our labour
She just smiled calmly mother knows that is the best smile
Tom fell with a cloven head
And vowed hed change the pigtails place
Daisy creams with pink edges
Toast from the bread fruit tree
First issue a reward
Age forty five if a day a lie
Fresh pain seized Pauls body
We have been fine havent we
The new born baby is stolen as we go
She jump at the tail and bite it savagely
An hour out of Guildford town
Now quicker the fiddle went
When such wanderers meet
And they were sandy yellow brownish all over
I make her quite nervy at times
I have had to grow old
Please hire me after you
Yes I miss her
A boat put outon the bay
Clear are your eyes and bright your breath
Fur flew through the air teeth gnashed
Id shoot myself a pause
Captain Tom receives an angry letter
That cloth does not look worth much
A lady is on Alices lap
that sounds good
I was not grabbed
The song is really louding on a gate
Fear neither root nor sprout
Still you owe it a duty
What am I Im a racer son of god
However somebody killed something
A raging fire wasin his eyes
It weighs seven point five kilogram
From each cake there sprang a huge dog
No thank you
Let it give us a chance my precious
But what about this thing sticky
He likes dragons very much
it isnt picked at all
You cruelty shall cost your life
Ill send for Tom to my boudoir
But the tune isnt his own invention
Her paw went into your eye
I am a selfish sinner
Ask god to help you
Pick pick pick
Do you know the lid opens
Her existence makes him pleasant
And the next day Nurse will be released
Born once every one hundred years dies in flames
It says no way shouted Daisy
The first year they sowed rye
Your own wife is not at home
He told me that I ought to change
Will call her Lili for short
Why should i care though Davids lips were twitching
Hurry up hurry up
If not I shall go no further
How rash you are
What would they do at the end of the year
Today isnt any other day
This is the way that snakes always talk
Both side were softly curved
We have showed his shark tooth
Give me your hand or I will cry harder than before
And has you slain him
Off for the prison ship
Do you think its a woozle
We can not do it sir
She and i are running a neck and neck race
In which piglet meets an elephant
You may imagine how I gape
Her kind and firm glance
The ladybug told them proudly
I am run off my feet
I have a soothsayer
She laughed
This was the twenty fifth of november seventeen eighty three
I must have two to fetch and carry
I would scoff at these followers
Mum shuts ones mouth up doesnt it
The song is called Ways and Means
As soon as she went in there was disorder
After a while he perceived both giants
I believe you are one of them
She said in subdued voice
Slam the doors and wedge them
Ive just shot a stag
We may join with that power
Chapter eleven on the doorstep
He showed no signs of age
But show me now your map
Chew leaves quickly said rabbit
I say I will be emperor
No admittance except on party business
Id just as soon swim your way as others do
Because he was a man with infinite resource and sagacity
You shouldnt have pricked him with your horn
Can your name be more hilarious
The end part is fish mouth
I know you
These words behind the ears is nonsense
Your path now goes south
He could not help doing so
Alice I wont forget it again
They had been named Tom and Jerry
Chapter eighteen the return journey
The straw charcoal and the pea
One two three where is your breakfast
A voice said Come in
She has felt shy of it
No said piggy carelessly
There goes the shawl again
The end of february fourteenth
She has a high voice
He is old fashioned but he is the best of men
Now I understand
I know how to obey orders
You woke me up
How Tom and Jerry went to visit mister Sam
She come back to the valley
His hope will cheat him
Six was half way down the room
Im sure your friends can wait
Five hundred and one million right
I am loath to see him go
How do you like you dirty bird
The fisherman and his wife see George every day
Please invite Tom if there is not requires
I owe them five hundred dollars
Perhaps you think that is a queer title for this chapter
He owed mister Lawson I cant tell you how
Why it is just like the round egg which sounds thin
I am safe back again
Father has yellow eyes
Give me a fine fat goose
Bob goes to a new school
Its to say how you do with Toms answer
A thief in the night
At length they came to a sharp bend
The name of the song is called haddocks
How could I dig burrows with short toe nails
Goat Billy asked the old chinese guy
Called out the cloud
A special pot too
Why did I wake up
And she caught at the brooch
She has no place for hot peper
They are made of wood
Its part of my secret
It would be a hard choice
And his heart wagged with joy like a lambs tail
She keeps saying Im hers
Shell be feverish after so much thinking
where are you going
You gain for nothing girl
Another one ten thousand dollars
But things havent change yet
Over them swooped the eagles
But mom Im not certain about
Pauls teeth ached because of lemon
And be with youTom
So Tom saw night as it were broad daylight
Enoughyou a foolish chatter
Why should I purchase my own
And what does it mean
Lucy a clever farmer
A whirring noise was heard
I am going to back home
What are you waiting for man
Dear customerwelcome to our ship
What do you think of this question
Do you have anything in mind
All smile were real and the happierthe more sincere
In which piglet meets a elephant
Enoughyou are foolish chatter
Its to say how do you do with Toms answer
Be off now quick you may
All the smile were real and happierthe more sincere
Born once every hundred years dies in flames
Be off now as quick you may
She is felt shy of it
Why is just like the round egg which sounds thin
And whats the gyre and to gimble
Why is this egg not broken
Then all we he say aha
Rabbit gave dog a hurrying up sort of nudge angry
From August eighteenth or their divorce
I never had a whooping cough why
She smiled calmly mother knows that is the best smile
